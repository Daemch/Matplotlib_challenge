The only thing of note for this challenge are the slight differences in the visuals. 


I was under the impression that as long as the data was correct, changing the format in a way that doesn't change the data is acceptable. 

Thus the color, order, size, and angles of the output are slightly different from the answer examples due to personal preferences. 

For example, I added grids to the scatterplots because I believe it provides better data readability.
